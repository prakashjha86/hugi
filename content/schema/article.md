# Article

Proper structured data in your news, blog, and sports article page can enhance your appearance in Google Search results. Enhanced features include entry in a top stories carousel and rich result features such as headline text and larger-than-thumbnail images.

### Article-Front-Matters

Article structured data are rendered and defined by the front-matters of your content. Following you will find an [example article](/examples/articles/first-article/) with and its output in the structured data:

```toml
date = "2016-11-18T19:28:41+02:00"
publishdate = "2016-11-18T19:28:41+02:00"
draft = false
title = "article example one"
description = "Short description of the article."

[amp]
    elements = []
    
[structured]
    type = "Article"

[author]
    name = "John Doe"

[image]
    src = "https://gohugo-amp.gohugohq.com/example-image.jpg"
    width = 1600
    height = 900
    title = "Example Article image"
    author = "gohugohq"
    link = "https://gohugohq.com"
    license = "CC BY 2.0"
    license_link = "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/"

[sitemap]
  changefreq = "monthly"
  priority = 0.5
  filename = "sitemap.xml"
```

This will generate the following **valid structured data** in the head-section:

```javsacript
<script type="application/ld+json">
